				Well, essenyially all of my projects are on hold currently. I've realized that the best way to do BorderlandsBot is in a web interface, and unluckily for me, I don't have the backend to support that.

				I've decided to start keeping a changelog and download link to the programs I'm developing on this webpage. Both for organization and
				consistency sake.<br /><br />
				There are currently two programs that I've added to the website: BorderlandsBot and Osu Music Player<br /><br />
				At the moment BorderlandsBot is under heavy development, but when it is done people who speedrun borderlands on Twitch will be able to
				add a bot to their channel (aka BorderlandsBot) and it will have general commands for the Borderlands games for questions that are asked
				fairly often. Once it is down, I plan for it to have custom commands, timers, and various other things. However, the first release will
				have preset commands that you can enable and disable.<br /><br />
				Osu Music Player is - as you can hopefully tell - a music player. It's visuals are inspiried by a rhythm game that goes by the name of
				osu!. The objective with this was to create a music player that had a low profile on screen, but still look nice.

				For those of you whom are wondering why there have been lack of updates on <i>Upgrade Incremental</i> is because I have been working on
				other projects that require a lot of planning and personal time. <br /><br />
				I have also been trying to find a job in attempt to improve various hardware and software components of my computer, though I have been
				unsuccessful thus far. <br /><br />
				I will keep this blog up to date with various information on when I will be able to resume Upgrade Incremental as well as other
				projects that I will be working on. As for now, Upgrade Incremental is on hold and when I have time to work on it, will be receiving a
				major overhaul in various aspects. <br /><br />
				Again, sorry for any inconvenience this has caused as well as concerns as to where I have dissappeared to.
