			<p>
				For those of you whom are wondering why there have been lack of updates on <i>Upgrade Incremental</i> is because I have been working on
				other projects that require a lot of planning and personal time. <br /><br />
				I have also been trying to find a job in attempt to improve various hardware and software components of my computer, though I have been
				unsuccessful thus far. <br /><br />
				I will keep this blog up to date with various information on when I will be able to resume Upgrade Incremental as well as other
				projects that I will be working on. As for now, Upgrade Incremental is on hold and when I have time to work on it, will be receiving a
				major overhaul in various aspects. <br /><br />
				Again, sorry for any inconvenience this has caused as well as concerns as to where I have dissappeared to.
